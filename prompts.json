  "Use `uv init` before starting. Build a Python Manim animation visualizer (with uv inline dependencies) for the equation `(x^2 + y^2 - 1)^3 = x^2 y^3`, and display the model name `<MODEL_NAME>` in the scene. Keep everything centered, well spaced, non-overlapping, and fully visible in frame.",
  "Organize the data from Notion page `<NOTION_PAGE_URL_OR_ID>` into an Airtable table. Infer sensible columns, normalize inconsistent values, and preserve every source row.",
  "Create a Tinder-like app for SF founders with swipe left/right interactions, founder profile cards, a match view, and realistic local mock data. Make it mobile-first and visually polished.",
  "Build a habit tracker that roasts the user when they miss habits. On a failed streak, generate a sad/stylized version of the user's profile picture and a short AI roast joke (funny, not abusive).",
  "Recreate a Gen 1 Pokemon Guessing Game from this reference: dark retro pixel style, centered title ('Pokemon Guessing Game'), top control row with input, Hint button, mute icon button, Reset button, trophy button, and score box; green feedback text ('Correct!'); and a large grid of numbered square tiles where correct guesses reveal Pokemon sprites in the right slots (e.g., #1 Bulbasaur, #4 Charmander, #7 Squirtle). Match layout, spacing, and retro styling closely.",
  "Create a CLI tool using `https://github.com/sst/opentui` with two commands: `image` to generate images with `<IMAGE_MODEL_OR_API>` and `video` to generate videos with `<VIDEO_MODEL_OR_API>`. Include clear help text, argument validation, and progress/status output.",
  "Create an interactive 3D pumpkin using Three.js and GSAP with smooth rotation/parallax on pointer movement and a short intro animation on load.",
  "Build a Linktree clone for developers in a neo-brutalist, minimal, GitHub-inspired design. Include the profile name `<YOUR_NAME>`, developer links, and a GitHub commits dashboard in the same style. Add a GSAP loading animation where a GitHub logo fills in, plus a subtle ASCII background animation that fits the aesthetic.",
  "Check all GitHub commits made last week (Monday-Sunday, local timezone) by the team and create a Linear task titled 'Weekly Summary' with exactly 5 bullet points explaining the most important changes in simple language.",
  "Create a mobile astrology app with Expo that generates images based on the user's zodiac sign using Nano Banana Pro (`<DOCS_LINK>`). Include sign selection, generate action, loading state, and a simple history/gallery view.",
  "Create a tool that uses a vision model (`<VISION_MODEL>`) to analyze images and rename them with accurate, human-readable, collision-safe filenames. Support batch folders and dry-run mode.",
  "Create a mobile Pomodoro timer app in steampunk style (Expo/React Native). The more focus sessions the user completes, the more their 'compute power' meter grows.",
  "Reproduce a game concept commonly seen in low-quality mobile ads, but make it genuinely playable and fun. Deliver the build plan as 12 concise prompts/steps, each adding one meaningful feature or polish improvement.",
  "Rebuild the experience shown in this reference post: `https://x.com/guo_hq/status/2021614632163565694?s=20`. Match the core UX flow, layout, motion, and visual style as closely as possible, using placeholder assets where needed."
